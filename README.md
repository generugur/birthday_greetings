# BIRTHDAY GREETINGS PROGRAM

*Every time this program is run, it checks if the birthday of your friends you have added to the list is today and sends an e-mail to them if their birthday is today.*

1. The e-mail address and password will be written as the inputs of the send_mail() function.

    ```
    def send_mail():
    
      global NAME
      
      my_email = "your email"
      
      password = "your password" 
    
2. In the birthday.csv file, write your friends' names, e-mail addresses, year of birth, month and day in csv format.

    `name,email,year,month,day`
